<h2>What is Lasagna?</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. <br>
    Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings
    such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include
    ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices.<br>
    The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking.
    Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven.<br>
    The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has
        sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
    <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves
        of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
    <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes,
        two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
    <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness
        and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
    <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with
        fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning,
        fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
    <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
    <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this
        lasagna extra decadent.</li>
    <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of
        the lasagna when you cut into it. </li>
</ul>
