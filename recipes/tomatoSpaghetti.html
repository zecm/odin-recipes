<h2>What is spaghetti?</h2>
<p>Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. <br>
    Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. <br>
    Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina. Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used,
    but whole wheat flour may be added. </p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 bunch of fresh basil.</li>
    <li>1 medium onion.</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic.</li>
    <li>1 kg ripe tomatoes , or 2 x 400g tins of quality chopped tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Olive oil.</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon red wine or balsamic vinegar </li>
    <li>480 g dried wholewheat spaghetti </li>
    <li>15 g Parmesan cheese </li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparation:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Pick the basil leaves onto a chopping board (reserving a few baby leaves to garnish),<br>
        then roughly chop the remaining leaves and finely chop the stalks.</li>
    <li>Peel and finely slice the onion and garlic. If using fresh, cut the tomatoes in half,<br>
        then roughly chop them or carefully open the tins of tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Put a saucepan on a medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the onion, then <br>cook for around 7 minutes, or until soft and lightly golden.</li>
    <li>Stir in the garlic and basil stalks for a few minutes, then add the fresh or tinned tomatoes and the vinegar.</li>
    <li>Season with a tiny pinch of salt and pepper, then continue cooking for around 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Stir in the chopped basil leaves, then reduce to low and leave to tick away. Meanwhile…</li>
    <li>Carefully fill a large pot three-quarters of the way up with boiling water, <br>
        add a tiny pinch of salt and bring back to the boil.</li>
    <li>Add the spaghetti and cook according to packet instructions – you want to cook <br>
        your pasta until it is al dente. This translates as ‘to the tooth’ and means that <br>
        it should be soft enough to eat, but still have a bit of a bite and firmness to it.<br>
        Use the timings on the packet instructions as a guide, but try some just before the time<br>
        is up to make sure it’s perfectly cooked.</li>
    <li>Once the pasta is done, ladle out and reserve a cup of the cooking water and keep it to one<br>
        side, then drain in a colander over the sink and tip the spaghetti back into the pot.</li>
    <li>Stir the spaghetti into the sauce, adding a splash of the pasta water to loosen, if needed.</li>
    <li>Serve with the reserved basil leaves sprinkled over the top and use a micro-plane to finely <br>
        grate the Parmesan cheese, then sprinkle over.</li>
</ol>
